WHAT IS QUICK PINTEREST
-----------------------

Quick Pinterest is the simples and most lightweight way to pin images you find on the web to Pinterest.
Just add this extension, login into Pinterest and right click on the images you want to pin.
One click and it's added to your selected Board.
Optionally, you can also change the text to be associated with it.


PINTEREST.JS LIBRARY
--------------------

This extension contains also a JavaScript library to work with Pinterest in an easy way.
Since Pinterest doesn't have an API (yet?) this library parses the official bookmarklet for data and
provides a simple API to it.

In version 1.0 the available functions are:

* **getBoards(fx)** to retrieve the boards list.
* **pin(boardId, mediaURL, description, fx)** to pin any media to pinterest
